Follow the instructions in the Python Packaging Guide:

Create an account on PyPI if you haven't yet.
Create the source distribution and wheels for your package: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
Install twine (or make sure you have version 2.0 or newer): pip install twine
Check your distribution files for errors: twine check dist/*
(Optional) Upload to the PyPI test server first (note: separate user registration required): twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
Upload to PyPI: twine upload dist/*
